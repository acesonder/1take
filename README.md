====  INTRODUCTION
1. Establish a Coordinated Response Team
Form a working group with representatives from:
Local government
Police and fire departments
Public health
Mental health/substance use professionals
Nonprofits/harm reduction organizations
Business owners
People with lived experience
This ensures that solutions are coordinated, not fragmented.
2. Implement Harm Reduction Strategies
Rather than simply trying to "remove" individuals, reduce harm and encourage safe behavior:
Sharps disposal containers and garbage bins in key areas
Mobile outreach or drop-in services offering clean supplies, naloxone, and referrals
Consider a supervised consumption site (if legal and feasible) or a peer-run support trailer
3. Increase Access to Treatment & Shelter
Partner with regional health authorities to improve access to detox and recovery services
Develop or expand emergency shelters, transitional housing, and supportive housing
Add outreach-based case management for people with complex needs
4. Improve Public Space Maintenance
Increase street cleaning, garbage pickup, and public washrooms
Introduce community ambassadors or peer workers to monitor problem areas and provide assistance
Use CPTED (Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design) principles to make spaces less conducive to loitering or unsafe activity (e.g., better lighting, clear sightlines)
5. Support Local Businesses and Residents
Set up a business support line or liaison to address safety concerns and coordinate clean-up
Offer grants or incentives for downtown businesses to enhance security or beautify storefronts
Host community events to bring residents back downtown in a positive, visible way
6. Policy & Enforcement Balance
Ensure enforcement is compassionate, consistent, and paired with referrals to services
Target trafficking and exploitation, not just users
Consider local bylaw updates that support coordinated responses (e.g., no-camping zones only if shelter is available)
7. Engage the Community
Hold town halls and listening sessions to ensure residents are heard
Launch a public education campaign to reduce stigma and encourage support for evidence-based approaches
Cobourg, with an estimated population of 21,425 in 2025, faces significant challenges related to substance use, homelessness, and housing affordability. The town has a 35-bed low-barrier emergency shelter at 310 Division Street, which also includes a 24/7 warming/cooling hub and plans for 10 transitional housing units .

However, community concerns have arisen regarding the shelter's impact on downtown safety and cleanliness, with reports of increased incidents involving substance use and discarded paraphernalia .
To address these issues, a comprehensive plan focusing on community engagement, safety, and housing solutions is essential.
üß≠ Strategic Plan for Community Engagement and Change
1. Community Engagement and Dialogue
Establish a Community Advisory Committee: Include representatives from the municipal council, local businesses, residents, shelter operators, and individuals with lived experience to foster open communication and collaborative problem-solving.
Host Regular Town Hall Meetings: Facilitate discussions to address concerns, share updates on shelter operations, and gather community feedback.
2. Enhance Public Safety and Cleanliness
Implement Community Safety Patrols: Collaborate with local law enforcement and community organizations to monitor and address safety concerns in the downtown area.
Increase Waste Management Efforts: Install additional garbage bins and sharps disposal containers in high-traffic areas to reduce litter and hazardous waste.
3. Expand Housing Solutions
Promote the Affordable & Rental Housing Community Improvement Plan (CIP): Encourage developers to utilize financial incentives for creating affordable housing units, including purpose-built rentals and second units .cobourg.ca

4. Address Substance Use with Compassionate Strategies
Implement Harm Reduction Programs: Provide access to clean supplies, overdose prevention education, and connections to treatment services through outreach programs.
Explore Supervised Consumption Services: Assess the feasibility of establishing supervised consumption sites to reduce public substance use and associated risks.
5. Monitor and Evaluate Progress
Develop Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Track metrics such as shelter occupancy rates, housing placements, and community safety incidents to assess the effectiveness of implemented strategies.
Regular Reporting: Provide transparent updates to the community on progress, challenges, and adjustments to the plan.
üß∞ Toolkit for Implementation
Community Advisory Committee Charter: Define the committee's purpose, membership, and operating procedures.
Town Hall Meeting Templates: Prepare agendas, presentation materials, and feedback forms for effective community meetings.
Safety Patrol Guidelines: Outline roles, responsibilities, and protocols for community safety patrols.
CIP Application Guides: Provide step-by-step instructions for developers to apply for housing incentives.

Sources
1. Humanize the Issue
Strategy: Share real stories of individuals with lived experience‚Äîstories of resilience, recovery, and contribution.
Tactics:
Storytelling campaign: Short video or social media profiles of local residents who have experienced homelessness or addiction and are now stable, employed, or giving back.
‚ÄúFaces of Cobourg‚Äù photo exhibit: Display photos and quotes from individuals using services‚Äîpresented with dignity and depth.
Invite speakers to town halls: Include peer support workers, recovery advocates, and local families.
Why it works: People are more likely to support change when they can emotionally connect and see the humanity behind the issue.
2. Reframe Language
Strategy: Use compassionate, strength-based language to reduce stigma.
Examples:
Replace ‚Äúaddicts‚Äù with ‚Äúpeople who use substances.‚Äù
Replace ‚Äúhomeless problem‚Äù with ‚Äúhousing and support needs.‚Äù
Talk about ‚Äúcommunity health and safety‚Äù rather than only ‚Äúenforcement‚Äù or ‚Äúremoval.‚Äù
Why it works: Language shapes perception. Respectful, inclusive wording can lower defensiveness and increase empathy.
3. Show the Broader Impact
Strategy: Link solutions to benefits for all Cobourg residents.
Tactics:
Emphasize that investing in housing and supports reduces emergency service costs, improves downtown business conditions, and makes public spaces cleaner and safer.
Provide evidence that cities with housing-first and harm reduction models have seen improvements in public health and safety.
Create visual dashboards showing progress (fewer emergency calls, more housing placements, cleaner streets).
Why it works: When people see that these strategies help the whole community, not just ‚Äúthem,‚Äù resistance drops.
4. Engage Local Champions
Strategy: Use respected community members to advocate for compassionate approaches.
Tactics:
Invite faith leaders, physicians, teachers, business owners, and police officers to speak publicly in support of change.
Encourage council members who are ‚Äúon the fence‚Äù to meet with service providers and frontline workers.
Why it works: People trust familiar faces more than outside experts.
5. Focus on Shared Values
Strategy: Highlight common ground like safety, dignity, and pride in Cobourg.
Messaging Examples:
‚ÄúEveryone deserves a clean, safe place to live.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe all want a thriving, safe downtown‚Äîand that starts with solutions that work.‚Äù
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make Cobourg a town we‚Äôre proud of‚Äîtogether.‚Äù
Why it works: Values-driven messages unify, while problem-focused messages divide.
6. Invite Participation in Solutions
Strategy: Move from ‚Äúus vs. them‚Äù to ‚Äúwe‚Äôre in this together.‚Äù
Tactics:
Launch a community clean-up day with people experiencing homelessness volunteering alongside residents.
Create opportunities for residents to volunteer at the shelter or help with food programs.
Host a community art or mural project about hope, belonging, or inclusion.
Why it works: Action breaks down fear. When people engage personally, their perceptions shift.
1. Sample Messaging Templates (for posters, social media, website)
General Community Message:
‚ÄúBuilding a Stronger Cobourg, Together.‚Äù
Everyone deserves to feel safe, supported, and seen. Our downtown challenges are real‚Äîbut so is our ability to come together and create solutions that work for everyone.
Join us as we invest in dignity, housing, safety, and support‚Äîfor all Cobourg residents.
Reframing Substance Use:
‚ÄúPeople First. Problems Solved.‚Äù
Substance use doesn‚Äôt define someone‚Äîit‚Äôs something they experience. With compassion, outreach, and connection, we can support people back to stability. It‚Äôs what strong communities do.
Housing Is a Solution:
‚ÄúThe Answer to Homelessness? Housing.‚Äù
Emergency services, bylaw enforcement, and cleanups cost more than housing support. When we invest in homes, everyone wins‚Äîour neighbors, our economy, and our town.

Here are detailed speaking notes to accompany the presentation titled ‚ÄúChanging the Conversation: A Path Forward for Cobourg.‚Äù These are written to align with a tone that is clear, confident, and compassionate‚Äîaimed at both skeptical and supportive audiences.
Slide 1: The Current Picture
Speaking Notes:
‚ÄúThank you everyone for being here today. We‚Äôre gathered because we all care deeply about Cobourg‚Äîour safety, our community, our future.
Lately, we‚Äôve heard a lot of concern about what‚Äôs happening downtown: about visible homelessness, discarded paraphernalia, and residents feeling unsafe.
But alongside that, we‚Äôre also hearing from people who are struggling: who feel unseen, unwanted, and unsupported.
These two Cobourgs‚Äîworried residents and vulnerable neighbors‚Äîaren‚Äôt separate. They‚Äôre part of the same challenge. And that means they‚Äôre also part of the same solution.‚Äù
Slide 2: What‚Äôs Really Happening?
Speaking Notes:
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs look at the facts. Cobourg has around 21,000 people. We have a 35-bed emergency shelter operating near capacity‚Äîand a housing affordability crisis.
Many of the people accessing services here are local. They‚Äôve grown up here, worked here, or have family ties here.
The reality is, without housing options or long-term supports, people are stuck cycling through shelters, ERs, police interactions, and public spaces. That‚Äôs stressful for them‚Äîand for the whole community.
And it‚Äôs not cheap. It costs the system far more to keep people homeless than it does to house them.‚Äù
Slide 3: What Works in Communities Like Ours
Speaking Notes:
‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have to reinvent the wheel. Other towns across Ontario‚Äîplaces with the same worries, the same divides‚Äîhave found solutions.
Programs like supportive housing, peer outreach, and community clean teams have reduced 911 calls, improved cleanliness, and helped people stabilize.
When we move from crisis response to proactive support, everyone wins.
This isn‚Äôt just about compassion‚Äîit‚Äôs about what works.‚Äù
Slide 4: Our Vision for Cobourg
Speaking Notes:
‚ÄúSo, what‚Äôs the vision? It‚Äôs not one side winning over the other. It‚Äôs a Cobourg where downtown is clean and safe‚Äîbecause people have homes, support, and purpose.
It‚Äôs a Cobourg where businesses thrive because streets are vibrant and welcoming‚Äînot because vulnerable people are pushed out of sight.
And it‚Äôs a Cobourg where we see our shared values reflected in action: dignity, community, safety, and responsibility.‚Äù
Slide 5: The Plan Forward
Speaking Notes:
‚ÄúWe can get there. But it will take commitment across the board.
Expanding affordable and supportive housing options
Improving public safety and cleanliness downtown
Using proven strategies like peer outreach and harm reduction
And most importantly: talking with‚Äînot about‚Äîpeople experiencing homelessness
This isn‚Äôt charity. This is community building.‚Äù
Slide 6: How You Can Help
Speaking Notes:
‚ÄúYou might be wondering‚Äîwhat can I do?
Share accurate information. Push back against stigma.
Volunteer. Talk to your neighbors.
Attend a town hall, join a community clean-up, or offer to mentor someone who‚Äôs rebuilding their life.
And if you‚Äôre in a position of leadership‚Äîmake decisions that are rooted in evidence, not fear.
We don‚Äôt need to be perfect. We just need to start moving forward‚Äîtogether.‚Äù
